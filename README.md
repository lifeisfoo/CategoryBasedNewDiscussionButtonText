# Category Based "New Discussion" button text for Vanilla Forums

You can change text of the button per category. 
E.g.: in your "Feedback" category the text of the "new" button can be "Leave a feedback" instead of the generic "New Discussion"

Install, enable and go to the settings page of the plugin.

Not configured categories will use Vanilla default text (from translation in use).
